# Javascript30-wesbos-training
This is my take of the 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge developed by WesBos.  
The original is [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

1. [DrumRoll](01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/drum_01.html): basic controls, key highlighting, playing sounds, animations, transitions, adding and removing classes, events listeners. 20 min session packed with info. Fun to build this first one.  
1. [Analogic Clock](02%20-%20JavaScript%20CSS%20Clock/02_JSClock.html): transitions, calling a function at set interval, multiple children of a class,...
